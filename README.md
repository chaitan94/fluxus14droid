Fluxus 2014
============

An app I had built for the annual tech/cultural fest of IIT Indore, Fluxus for the year 2014.
This is an open source release of that app upon request from other students.
While the app was originally built in old android format and was targetting API 14, this is a slightly cleaned up version of the same app. It now targets API 27, and uses the newer android format.

For building newer apps like this, I would not suggest building on top of this. Instead try a more modern tool like [react native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
